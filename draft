# As well as the elements associated with being a superhost (ratings)?, do they earn more (price)? Where are they in the city?

# From previous queries we learned that there were only 6 listings in Hampstead, it's probably an exception.
# We can see that in some neighbourhoods superhosts aren't even charging as much as the regular ones (especially in the Plateau where properties are in demand and superhosts have high revenue potential
# Maybe Airbnb should notify the hosts about it to help them price their properties right for more revenue
# There's also the possibility that the regular hosts aren't attracting as many guests as they could because they are pricing their properties too expensive
# Either way, it has something to do with Airbnb helping their hosts with pricing
